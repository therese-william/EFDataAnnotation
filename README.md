# Entity Framework Data Annotations

Define data annotations for entity framework entities

If you need to add Display, Required, .... for models auto generated by entity framework, then you shouldn't do that in the auto generated classes themselves, or you will loose everything if you need to regenerate them at anytime, the best solution for that is to have two .cs files:

1- MetaData.cs -> this will contain the entities classes named ClassNameMetaData with the same field names of the ClassName and needed annotations associated to them.

2- PartialClasses.cs -> this will contain partial classes of the entities classes contained in MetaData.cs but with their ClassName and with a MetaDataType annotation with the type of ClassNameMetaData to associate the annotations defined in the meta class to the entity class without changing anything in the main class.
